## 🔓 Unlock Instructions

To unlock protected **Excel spreadsheets** and access the free **GPT-powered Companion Agent**, you’ll need the password found in your copy of the book.

🧠 **Where to Find the Password**
Open the book and locate the section titled **“Keeping Records”** (**Page 200** in printed book)
Find the **first paragraph** under that heading
The **7th word** in that paragraph is your password (**case-sensitive**)

🤖 **Access the Companion Agent**
Ask spreadsheet-related questions while working through the book:
🔗 [Launch the Companion Agent] (https://excel-companion-agent-aysoagu94y8dhugeopabzf.streamlit.app)

You'll be prompted to enter the same password above for access.
Once unlocked, the agent will assist with **Excel and LibreCalc** concepts only.
